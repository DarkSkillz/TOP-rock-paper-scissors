get system choice
get the player choice

possible situations:
    #1 Tie = both choose the same
    #2 Player wins (
        player chose rock vs scissors
        player chose paper vs rock
        player chose scissors vs paper 
    )
    #3 Player looses by any other outcome

create a function that check's the score before starting a new round, if any score is >= 3 declare the winner and end the game

compare the two choices
if both are the same
    output a tie and start next round
else if any of the player winning conditions are true
    increment the player's score by 1, check the scores and start the next round
else 
    increment the system's score the 1, check the scores and start the next round
